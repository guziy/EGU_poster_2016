\begin{abstract}
Lakes influence the regional climate and hydrology in a number of ways and therefore they should be represented
in climate models in a realistic manner. Lack of representation of lakes in models can lead to errors in simulated
energy and water fluxes, for lake-rich regions. This study focuses on the assessment of the impact of climate
change on lakes and hydrology as well as on the influence of lakes on projected changes to regional climate
and surface hydrology, particularly streamflows, for Northeast Canada. To this end, transient climate change
simulations spanning the 1950–2100 period are performed, with and without lakes, with the fifth generation of
the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), driven by the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) at the
lateral boundaries for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5.

Comparison of projected changes from the CRCM5 simulations with and without lakes suggest that lakes
attenuate projected increases to 2-m air temperature in all seasons, almost everywhere in the study domain, with
maximum decreases of the order of 2$^\circ$C occurring during winter. As for streamflows, results suggest projected
increases for winter and spring and decreases during summer. Comparison of the projected changes suggests
that lakes attenuate the projected increases in streamflows in spring due to the storage effect of lakes, and
also attenuate the projected decreases in streamflows in summer in future climate due to the gradual release of
the excess water stored in the lakes during spring. This study, thus demonstrates the impact of lakes on projected
changes to the regional climate and hydrology for the study region using a single regional modelling system.

\section*{(A) Introduction}
Inland water bodies, such as lakes and rivers, are essential for human
livelihood (i.e. drinking water, agriculture, hydroelectricity, transportation),
and this has led to many activities around lakes and rivers, which in turn
resulted in the development of expensive and important infrastructure in the
proximity of such water bodies. The safety and proper functioning of these
infrastructures in the context of a changing climate is a major concern. For
this reason, it is important to assess projected changes to the hydrological
cycle and related uncertainties.

Though many climate models, particularly RCMs, include lakes, only few studies
have attempted to realistically simulate the water balance of lakes, considering
inflows and outflows of lakes, and the impact of lakes on streamflows. Huziy and
Sushama (2015) recently implemented a river/lake routing scheme, interflow
process, i.e. the lateral flow of water in the top soil layers along topographic
slopes, and interactions between lakes and rivers in terms of water balance in
the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). By including lake
routing, they noticed significant improvements to the simulated spring peak and
winter low flows, which were too high and too low, respectively, without the
lake-river interaction. The impacts of interflow on simulated streamflow and on
the regional climate were modest according to their study. These new
implementations in CRCM5 by Huziy and Sushama (2015) resulted in a more
comprehensive tool for regional climate change studies that can be used to
better understand interactions between atmosphere, lakes and rivers in the
context of a changing climate.

This study therefore focuses on the projected changes to the regional climate
and hydrology for northeastern Canada using CRCM5, and estimates the
impacts of lake-river, lake-atmosphere interactions and of interflow on the
projected changes to selected hydrologic/near-surface climate variables under
the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP85). For this scenario, the
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise during the
21st century, causing an increase in the radiative forcing of 8.5 ${\rm W/m^2}$ by 2100
with respect to the preindustrial period. The study domain covers 21
watersheds that are important for various economic activities (notably
hydropower generation) and contain a large number of subgrid lakes for which the
use of a 1D column lake model is appropriate.

\section*{(E) Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of projected changes from the simulations with and without lakes suggests important impact of lakes on projected increases to 2-m temperatures, due to thermal inertia of lakes.
\item Amplitudes of projected changes to streamflows are mostly dampened by lake-river interactions. Although a north-south dipole pattern, due to frozen conditions, can be noted in winter.
\end{itemize}
